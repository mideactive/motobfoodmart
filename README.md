### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for the frontend.
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language for the backend.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control system for tracking changes.

### Backend Setup (Python/Flask):

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/motobfoodmart.git

# Frontend Setup (JavaScript/React):

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd motobfoodmart/motobfoods

3. Create a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   source venv/bin/activate

5. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Set up the database:
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade

7. Run the Flask development server:
   flask run
   The backend server will be running at http://localhost:5000.

# Frontend Setup (JavaScript/React):
  
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd motobfoodmart/frontend

Notes:
Make sure both the backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously.
Adjust the API endpoints in the frontend code if needed (located in the motobfoodmart/frontend/src/api directory).
The application uses a SQLite database by default. If you plan to deploy it for production, consider using a more robust database like PostgreSQL.


This version of the instructions assumes you are using Python 3, and it specifies the correct commands for creating a virtual environment, activating it, and running the development servers on a Linux Ubuntu environment. Adjustments have been made to reflect Linux conventions.
